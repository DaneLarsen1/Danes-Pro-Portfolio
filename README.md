# React Portfolio

## Overview

This React Portfolio is designed to showcase my development projects and skills as a web developer. This single-page application highlights my proficiency in React and modern web development techniques. It is deployed on Netlify and is structured to provide a seamless user experience, featuring dynamic content loading without page refreshes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes a mobile-first design approach.
- **Dynamic Single-Page Application**: Built with React, enabling dynamic content updates without reloading the page.
- **Interactive UI**: Incorporates interactive elements such as modals, carousels, and form validation.
- **Navigation**: Includes a persistent navigation bar that allows easy access to various sections like About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.

## Sections

### About Me
- Presents a brief introduction and a recent photograph or avatar.
- Highlighted by default when the portfolio loads.

### Portfolio
